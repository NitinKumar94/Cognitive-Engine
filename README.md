# Cognitive-Engine

A cognitive radio is a wireless communications device capable of sensing the environment and making decisions on how to use the available radio resources to enable communications with a certain quality of service. The cognitive engine - the intelligent system behind the cognitive radio, combines sensing, learning, and optimization algorithms to control and adapt the radio system from the physical layer and up the communication stack.

This repository is a simulation of a cognitive engine selecting its operating parameters based on a predefined set of environmental parameters using the Genetic Algorithm optimization approach.
